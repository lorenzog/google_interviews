Here are two repositories related to Google questions:

    google_primes_in_e 

Contains code I wrote back in 2006 (probably) to tinker with one of the many google billboards. It looks for prime numbers of a certain length in the Nepero number 'e'. To do so I googled for a list of primes and searched them in an expansion of 'e'. I think :) it was some time ago and I never touched the code again. 

The second repository,

    google_interview

Is an interview question asked usually at Google. I just sat down and wrote it, as an excuse to dust off my coding skills. And I did it in C and Python.
